            Introduction: The Struggle with Course Management in Higher
            Education
          </h3>
          <p>
            University students juggle a multitude of responsibilities:
            attending lectures, completing assignments, preparing for exams, and
            managing extracurricular activities. Amidst this whirlwind, keeping
            track of past courses and fulfilling graduation requirements can
            become a significant burden. Traditional methods often involve
            cluttered spreadsheets, leading to confusion and missed
            opportunities.
          </p>
          <h3

            The Problem: Disorganized Course Tracking and Missed Opportunities
          </h3>
          <p>
            In it's annual report, the Condition of Education 2009, the U.S.
            Department of Education described graduation rates for American
            students. A recent study by the National Center for Education
            Statistics found that 39% of undergraduate students take six or more
            years to graduate. One contributing factor is inefficient course
            planning. Students may forget prerequisites, miss registration
            deadlines for required courses, or struggle to identify electives
            that align with their interests and career goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Real-world examples illustrate these struggles. Sarah, a junior
            majoring in Computer Science, relies on a bulky binder to store her
            course syllabi. Finding specific prerequisites or remembering which
            professors she enjoyed becomes a time-consuming task. John, a
            sophomore, uses a cluttered spreadsheet to track his credits but
            struggles to visualize his progress towards graduation. Both Sarah
            and John would benefit from a streamlined system to organize their
            course history and plan for the future.

          <p>
            Our Course Tracker application addresses these real-world problems
            by offering a centralized platform for students to manage their
            academic journeys. By providing a user-friendly interface for
            recording past courses, the app eliminates the need for paper
            records and cluttered spreadsheets. Students can easily access
            information like course names, semesters, professors, and grades.

            Beyond Course History: Planning for a Successful Future

          <p>
            The optional feature of suggesting future courses takes the app a
            step further. By considering a student's interests, completed
            coursework, remaining semesters, and graduation requirements, the
            app can recommend relevant electives and required courses. This
            empowers students to plan their academic paths strategically,
            ensuring they graduate on time and with a well-rounded education.
