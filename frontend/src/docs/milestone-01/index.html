          <strong>Introduction: </strong>

          <br />

          Our application aims to streamline course management for students,
          providing features such as course history tracking, degree
          requirements completion status, and optional course recommendations
          based on user preferences and past courses. The following data
          requirement analysis outlines the key data categories necessary for
          the successful implementation of the application.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>Course History Data: </strong>

          <br />

          One of the core use cases of our Course Tracker application revolves
          around managing a student's course history. This includes storing
          information about each course taken, such as the course name,
          semester, year, professor, credits earned, grades (optional), and any
          additional notes. As users interact with the application, adding and
          modifying their course history, the system must maintain accurate and
          organized records to facilitate functions like viewing past courses,
          tracking progress, and generating degree completion status reports
          using the course history data. Hence, the course history data is
          managed and displayed in the form of semester-segmented tables with
          each section containing the courses taken, the credits earned for
          each, and the total credits for that semester.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>Degree Completion Status Data: </strong>

          <br />

          Another crucial aspect of our application is monitoring the completion
          status of degree requirements. This requires storing data related to
          the specific requirements for a particular degree program, such as
          mandatory courses, elective courses, credit thresholds, and completion
          criteria for different academic areas (e.g., mathematics, computer
          science core courses). Additionally, the system needs to track which
          requirements have been fulfilled by the user's completed courses,
          displaying progress indicators and highlighting completed sections for
          the user's reference on the Degree Completion Status page.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>Course Recommendation Data: </strong>

          <br />

          To further enhance the functionality of our application, we are
          conceptualizing the potential and optional idea of incorporating a
          course recommendation feature based on various factors, including user
          interests, past course history, remaining semesters, and graduation
          requirements. To enable this functionality, the system requires data
          related to course offerings, prerequisites, course descriptions, and
          relevant academic pathways. Additionally, user preferences and
          historical data about courses taken by similar users may help build
          the recommendation algorithm.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>User Account Information Data: </strong>

          <br />

          Our application will also have a user account page for managing
          personal information and preferences. This includes storing data such
          as the user's name, date of birth (if needed), anticipated semester of
          graduation, major, and any other relevant profile details.
          Additionally, our application may store authentication credentials for
          user login purposes, ensuring secure access to personalized features
          and data. While maintaining user privacy and security, this data
          enables personalized interactions with the application.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>Conclusion: </strong>

          <br />

          To summarize, our Course Tracker application requires rigorous data
          management to support its core functionalities effectively. From
          maintaining comprehensive course histories to tracking degree
          completion progress and offering personalized recommendations, the
          system must handle diverse data types efficiently in order to provide
          students with valuable insights, streamline academic planning, and
          enhance their overall educational experience.

          This wireframe represents the central hub for students to visualize
          their academic progress over time. By showcasing a carousel of past
          semesters, ordered from latest to oldest, users can easily navigate
          navigate through their course history. Each semester section displays
          course details such as name, credits earned, and a cumulative total in
          tabular form. The inclusion of an 'Add Course' option allows users to
          update their course history in a frictionless manner. A prominent
          progress bar serves as a visual indicator of degree completion,
          allowing users to track their advancement towards graduation.

          The motivation for the project comes from our personal experiences
          when it comes to course planning. Every semester, students choose the
          courses they are going to take the following semester. This process
          often includes first looking at all the courses they have taken in the
          past, checking the requirements they need to graduate, and then
          figuring out which courses they can take to fulfill those
          requirements. This process can be time-consuming and confusing,
          especially for students who have taken a lot of courses.

          <br />

          <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
            <img src="./assets/spreadsheet.png" class="w-3/5" />

              All students use some kind of a tracking sheet
            </h1>
          </div>
          <br />

          Every student maintains some kind of a spreadsheet or document to keep
          track of this information. These sheet have some way to indicate total
          credits taken and progress towards graduation. Spire, our university
          tool, also include an ARR (Academic Requirements Report), but this
          report can be slow, hard to read, and sometimes inaccurate.

          <br />

          Our application aims to simplify this process by providing a single
          platform where students can save all the courses they have taken, the
          requirements they have fulfilled, and the requirements they still need
          to fulfill. This will help students plan their courses more
          efficiently and ensure they are on track to graduate on time.

          For our team, this project marks an important milestone for both team
          work and knowledged gained throughout our university journey. We all
          know going into this that the knowledge and skills acquired from
          various semesters and courses is finally going to be exercised to
          their full potential.

          <br class="my-1" />

          An important experience is everyone's ability to work together as a
          team. Management books talk about the importance of communication,
          delegation, and collaboration. This project will be a test of our
          ability to apply these skills in a real-world scenario. We will have
          to work together to ensure that the project is completed on time and
          meets all the requirements.

          <br class="my-1" />

          This project will also test our software engineering skills. How well
          can we design a system that is maintainable, and efficient? How well
          can we write code that is clean, and readable? How well can we test
          our code to ensure that it is bug-free and reliable? All of these
          challenges will be tested by building CourseView.
