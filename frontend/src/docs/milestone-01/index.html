          The motivation for the project comes from our personal experiences
          when it comes to course planning. Every semester, students choose the
          courses they are going to take the following semester. This process
          often includes first looking at all the courses they have taken in the
          past, checking the requirements they need to graduate, and then
          figuring out which courses they can take to fulfill those
          requirements. This process can be time-consuming and confusing,
          especially for students who have taken a lot of courses.

              All students use some kind of a tracking sheet
            </h1>
          </div>
          <br />

          Every student maintains some kind of a spreadsheet or document to keep
          track of this information. These sheet have some way to indicate total
          credits taken and progress towards graduation. Spire, our university
          tool, also include an ARR (Academic Requirements Report), but this
          report can be slow, hard to read, and sometimes inaccurate.

          <br />

          Our application aims to simplify this process by providing a single
          platform where students can save all the courses they have taken, the
          requirements they have fulfilled, and the requirements they still need
          to fulfill. This will help students plan their courses more
          efficiently and ensure they are on track to graduate on time.

          For our team, this project marks an important milestone for both team
          work and knowledged gained throughout our university journey. We all
          know going into this that the knowledge and skills acquired from
          various semesters and courses is finally going to be exercised to
          their full potential.

          <br class="my-1" />

          An important experience is everyone's ability to work together as a
          team. Management books talk about the importance of communication,
          delegation, and collaboration. This project will be a test of our
          ability to apply these skills in a real-world scenario. We will have
          to work together to ensure that the project is completed on time and
          meets all the requirements.

          <br class="my-1" />

          This project will also test our software engineering skills. How well
          can we design a system that is maintainable, and efficient? How well
          can we write code that is clean, and readable? How well can we test
          our code to ensure that it is bug-free and reliable? All of these
          challenges will be tested by building CourseView.
